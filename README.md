### Abstract
National parks serve as sanctuaries for diverse flora and fauna, playing a pivotal role in biodiversity conservation. The National Park Service's database provides a detailed record of species across these protected areas, enabling researchers and conservationists to monitor ecological dynamics and species health. Analyzing this dataset using R not only demonstrates data manipulation and analytical skills but also aids in developing effective conservation strategies by identifying patterns in species distribution, abundance, biological phenotype and conservation status. This project seeks to leverage the rich data provided to enhance our understanding and management of national park biodiversity. 

The data was accessed via Kaggle which can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nationalparkservice/park-biodiversity).
